                <p>For starters, we would like to thank you all for your love and support.<img src="img/heart.png" class="icon">
                    <br>
                    We are very excited to start this new chapter together and we can't wait to celebrate it with you!
                    <br>
                     In this page you will find all the details about the wedding.</p>
                <p class="rome-caption">Now, before starting with the details, my soon-to-be Italian wife insisted on sharing with you all a recipe, and since I am practicing for when we will be married, I figured I had better listen.</p>
                <h2>Recipe for "THE UNEXPECTED" relationship</h2>
                <p>Ingredients:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Three weeks of study abroad</li>
                    <li>3 years of long distance relationship </li>
                    <li>A unique taxi driver for your trips in Rome</li>
                    <li>8 trips across the Atlantic Ocean</li>
                    <li>Lots of family moments</li>
                    <li>Optional: Add a family trip to Disney World (that depends on whether you want for the relationship to last)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Directions:</p>
                <p>Take your pot and start adding all the ingredients; now patience is key, you want for each ingredient's taste to be preserved and just mold with each other. In order to achieve that, add them slowly
                    <br>
                    Then here it is, ready to eat!
