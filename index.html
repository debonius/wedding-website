                <h1>Welcome</h1>
                <p>For starters, we would like to thank you all for your love and support.<img src="img/heart.png" class="icon">
                    <br>
                    We are very excited to start this new chapter together and we can't wait to celebrate it with you!
                    <br>
                     In this page you will find all the details about the wedding.</p>
                <p class="rome-caption">Now, before starting with the details, my soon-to-be Italian wife insisted on sharing with you all a recipe, and since I am practicing for when we will be married, I figured I had better listen.</p>
                <h2>Recipe for <span>"THE UNEXPECTED"</span> relationship</h2>
                <p>Ingredients:</p>
                <ul class="recipe">
                    <li>Three weeks of <span>study abroad</span></li>
                    <li>3 years of <span>long distance relationship</span></li>
                    <li>A unique taxi driver for your <span>trips in Rome</span></li>
                    <li>8 trips <span>across the Atlantic Ocean</span></li>
                    <li>Lots of <span>family moments</span></li>
                    <li>Optional: Add a <span>family trip</span> to Disney World (that depends on whether you want for the relationship to last)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Directions:</p>
                <p>Take your pot and start adding all the ingredients. Now patience is key, you want for each ingredient's taste to be preserved and not just blend with each other; that way everything will take a part in making the whole thing better without taking the uniqueness from each individual element. In order to achieve that, add them slowly. When you feel that it has reached the right amount of good moments, lessons and growth together, remove from heat  
                    <br>
                    and start enjoying it!
